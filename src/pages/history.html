                    <p>The <span class="highlight">Ford Focus</span> was introduced in <span class="highlight">1998</span> as a replacement for the long-running Ford Escort. <br> Designed by Fordâ€™s European division, it featured a radical new design language called <span class="highlight">"New Edge"</span>, which included sharp lines and bold styling. <br> The first generation was available in hatchback, sedan, and wagon body styles.</p>
                    <p>One of its biggest selling points was its <span class="highlight">advanced suspension system</span>, which gave it class-leading handling. <br> The Focus quickly became a favorite among driving enthusiasts and was widely praised by the automotive press.</p>
                    <p>Performance versions, such as the <span class="highlight">Focus RS (2002)</span>, featured a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine producing 215 horsepower, making it one of the most exciting hot hatches of the early 2000s.</p>
